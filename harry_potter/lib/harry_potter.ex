defmodule HarryPotter do
  @moduledoc """

  Once upon a time there was a series of 5 books about a very English hero
  called Harry. (At least when this Kata was invented, there were only 5. Since
  then they have multiplied) Children all over the world thought he was
  fantastic, and, of course, so did the publisher. So in a gesture of immense
  generosity to mankind, (and to increase sales) they set up the following
  pricing model to take advantage of Harryâ€™s magical powers.

  One copy of any of the five books costs 8 EUR. If, however, you buy two
  different books from the series, you get a 5% discount on those two books. If
  you buy 3 different books, you get a 10% discount. With 4 different books,
  you get a 20% discount. If you go the whole hog, and buy all 5, you get a
  huge 25% discount.

  Note that if you buy, say, four books, of which 3 are different titles, you
  get a 10% discount on the 3 that form part of a set, but the fourth book
  still costs 8 EUR.

  Potter mania is sweeping the country and parents of teenagers everywhere are
  queueing up with shopping baskets overflowing with Potter books. Your mission
  is to write a piece of code to calculate the price of any conceivable
  shopping basket, giving as big a discount as possible.
